//! Nurse Strategy patter implementation for recovery methods.
//!
//! If you do not know what Strategy patter is here is a small
//! description.
//!
//! >The basic idea behind the Strategy pattern is that, given an
//! > algorithm solving a particular problem,  we define only
//! > the skeleton of the algorithm at an abstract level, and we
//! > separate the specific algorithm’s implementation into
//! > different parts.
//! >
//! > In this way, a client using the algorithm may choose
//! > a specific implementation, while the general algorithm
//! > workflow remains the same. In other words, the abstract
//! > specification of the class does not depend on the specific
//! > implementation of the derived class, but specific implementation
//! > must adhere to the abstract specification.
//!
//! So in this specific case the nurse command may need
//! different kind of recovery algorithm, so we should
//! be able to choose the algorithm at runtime.
