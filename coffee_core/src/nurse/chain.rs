//! Nurse Chain of Responsibility rust implementation
//!
//! If you do not know what Chain Of Responsibility pattern
//! is, here is a small description:
//!
//! > Chain of Responsibility is behavioral design pattern
//! > that allows passing request along the chain of potential
//! > handlers until one of them handles request.
//! >
//! > The pattern allows multiple objects to handle the
//! > request without coupling sender class to the concrete
//! > classes of the receivers. The chain can be composed
//! > dynamically at runtime with any handler that follows
//! > a standard handler interface.
//!
//! In our case we do not need to handle a request, but we should
//! handler through the various recovery strategies to see what can
//! be applied.
//!
//! So in our case the handler is a specific recovery strategy
//! that tell the chain of responsibility if can be applied or not.
//!
//! If can be applied, the chain of responsibility will apply it.
//!
//! P.S: I do not know if my Advanced System programming teacher will be
//! proud of me for the following design, or simply mad with me!
//!
